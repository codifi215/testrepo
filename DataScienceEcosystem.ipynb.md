   Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
    # Addition
      result1 = 5 + 3

    # Subtraction
      result2 = 10 - 4

    # Multiplication
      result3 = 6 * 2
    print(result1, result2, result3, result4)  # Output: 8 6 12 4.0
    
 This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

```python
(3*4)+5
```
